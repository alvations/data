1	1	B	2	I was a resident , although very young of the sta- , of what is now the state of Alaska in nineteen fifty-nine when Alaska stopped being a territory and became a state . Uh , so I guess I have a left over positive feeling about the question even though I do n't know very much about Puerto Rico . Uh , I know that all the things that happened , relative to that territory in Alaska have been very positive , uh , and I have a suspicion that , that I believe that a , the statehood is a good idea whenever you have a territory the size of Puerto Rico one ought either to make it a full-fledged state or , or let it go , one or the other .

1	2	A	3	Well , I 'm , I guess I do n't have su- , such close experience with , with , um , an area becoming a state as you do . Um , my concern is the economy because as I understand it Puerto Rico has a very low sta- , uh , standard of living or at least , um , annual average income . Um , part of this I suppose is justified in , in that the climate they do n't need , perhaps , the heating and the housing that some of the more northern territories need . However , in that case , I guess I would favor status quo . I have been to Puerto Rico and , and found it very , very interesting . I did Peace Corps training there .

1	9	B	10	I guess , um , we 're assuming that , that Puerto Rico would be per capita significantly more poor perhaps than , than say Mississippi or ,	PRP VBP , UH , PRP VBP VBG IN , IN NNP NNP MD VB IN NNS RB RBR JJ RB IN , IN UH NNP CC ,
1	10	A	11	I think so .	PRP VBP RB .
1	11	B	12	Okay , that 's something that , that I guess I have not much of an image of other than , than Puerto Rico as a tropical island and consequently large numbers of barefoot natives or something not in a perjuritive sense but in a , in a carefree sense , I guess . Although I 'm aware of the political problems and unrest , and , and also difficulties they have . Um , I do n't know whether state woul , statehood would improve their economy . I do n't , I do n't know that the ve- , the act of being a state would have any impact on , on them . Uh , I guess they would have the ability to do some taxing that they do n't have now . But of course if their economy is weak the- , there is not much of a base on which to tax . I do n't know if they suffer in a sense of income loss as being , since they are n't a state , whether there are monies that escape them so to speak because they are n't able to tax like a typical state would be . How do you feel , though , about , well I guess it 's to their advantage to be a territory , but , um , I wonder how have , having been in a territory but only as a young student and my parents were in the military at the time so they did n't have ready negative feelings about being in , in Alaska at the time since they voted absentee . I , I would imagine that it must be a little bit of a se- , feeling of second class citizenry , uh , to be in a territory that large and not being able to vote . The District of Columbia people , for instance are quite frustrated , I think , at times in their not having a Senate representative .
